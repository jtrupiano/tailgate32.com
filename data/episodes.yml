    Back to the heart of the midwest they go.  First up is a pilgrimage to the RV Hall of 
    Fame in Elkhart, Indiana where Mike and John get to sit in and admire the original 
    model of the Holiday Rambler they drive today.  After another RV mishap, they make it 
    to the lots and are greeted by rainy and cold weather.  But spirits remained high as 
    the legendary Pipers, the Indy Blue Crew and the Colts Disciples and welcomed Mike 
    and John with some of that famous Hoosier Hospitality.

    Mike and John stroll into Washington for stop #28 on their marathon journey.  Before 
    they hit the lots though, the brothers notice they're starting to get a little pudgy, 
    so they enlist the help of Pro Bowler Lorenzo Alexander.  After shedding a few pounds 
    at the gym they're back tailgating again.  They get a surprise visit from Washington 
    Redskins' GM Bruce Allen and spend some quality time with the Hogettes and the 
    ExtremeSkins tailgaters.

    John and Mike race back up the east coast for a second round with the fans of New York.  
    This time, it's the Jets' turn.  Despite the rough season it's still a great turnout 
    at the tailgate--they check in with Mohawk Mitch, an aspiring new superfan, the Jets 
    Bus, and Flag Man, all the while slurping down green shot after green shot.  They 
    finish up the day with one of Reverend Bill's famous ceremonies at the Tailgate 
    Tabernacle Church.  Learn to live it, learn to love it!
