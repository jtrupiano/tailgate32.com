    Brothers John and Mike Trupiano are set to embark on a cross country journey that is 
    sure to make any fan of the NFL and Tailgating a bit jealous. This fall, they are 
    hopping in a RV and are attending one home game for all 32 NFL Teams. During their 
    trip, they'll interview fans, participate in local traditions, host a large public 
    tailgate at each stadium, and uncover what makes these experiences special to each 
    fan base.
