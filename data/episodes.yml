    The Gateway to the West awaits the brothers, but not before getting tripped up in 
    Tulsa at the infamous Mercury Lounge.  The boys spend a day in the Lou with Ram Man, 
    tour the stadium lots with King Ram, and take a ride on the Short Bus, all before 
    witnessing a revitalized St. Louis Rams team take down the division leading Cardinals.
