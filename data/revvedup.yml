    experience, including a behind-the-scenes look at how a racing team prepares for each 
    week's race. With appearances from NASCAR drivers, track presidents, town mayors, team 
    owners, and very colorful fans, the brothers showcase racing culture at its finest.

    It's Mike and John's first time at the track, and they're intent to find out what the
    big deal is.  They enlist the help of Santa, a lifelong race fan from Charlotte, who
    guides them through the RV lots and teaches them how the racing traditions differ
    from their football equivalents.  They finish up by getting advice from race fans
    about how to pick their favorite drivers.
