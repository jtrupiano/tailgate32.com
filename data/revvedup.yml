    Mike and John are at it again!  This summer the guys dive into the entire racing 
    experience, including a behind-the-scenes look at how a racing team prepares for each 
    week's race. With appearances from NASCAR drivers, track presidents, town mayors, team 
    owners, and very colorful fans, the brothers showcase racing culture at its finest.
