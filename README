Website for Tailgate32: The Ultimate Football Fan Roadtrip

-----------------------------------------------------------

Several assets are shared with blog.tailgate32.com -- still need to come up with a 
better solutions for managing these.  The relative paths to all of these assets differ 
in WP and it currently is a manual process to ensure that we don't fuck these up when 
moving the changes over.

  * tailgate32.css -- some of the paths in here are affected.
  * tailgate32.js
  * various images in public/images/   (document these)
  * various snippets in index.html    (all found in footer.php and header.php on the blog)

Need to come up with a solution for this ASAP.
